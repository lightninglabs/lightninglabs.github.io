In this post we'll be performing a walk-through of the installation of `lnd`,
we’ll take a tour of several of its features, and we'll also introduce the
first Testnet Lightning Faucet to be compatible with `lnd`.

## Setting up LND

As of posting time (January 19, 2017),
[v0.1.1-alpha](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.1.1-alpha)
is the latest release of of `lnd`. You should be able to follow the
walk-through below using either the latest release or the current `master`
branch of `lnd`.

There are currently two primary methods for the initial building and setting up
of `lnd`: manual installation directly on your host operating system, or a
fully packaged instance of `lnd` that uses a docker container.

### Manual Build

First, the manual build. Before we begin, ensure that you have
[`go1.7.4`](https://golang.org/dl/) installed and also that [your `GOPATH` is
set properly](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). Finally, you'll also
need to have [`glide`](https://glide.sh/) installed locally:

```
go get -u -v github.com/Masterminds/glide
```

#### Installing btcd

A node on the Lightning Network requires an up-to date view of the Bitcoin
network. Currently `lnd` uses `btcd` to provide such a view in order to
determine when a funding transaction has received enough confirmations, when a
channel is closed, whether a open channel proof is valid, when a commitment
transaction has been broadcast, etc.

Prior to standing up `lnd`, you'll need an active `btcd` node running in
`testnet` mode. The following commands will properly fetch, build, and start up
your `btcd` node:

```
go get -v -u github.com/roasbeef/btcutil
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/roasbeef/btcd
glide install
go install . ./cmd/...
```

With those command executed, `btcd` will be properly installed on your system.
Next, we'll need to get the `btcd` node up and running in `testnet` mode (note
that you should replace `kek` with a username and password of your choice)

```
btcd --testnet --txindex --rpcuser=kek --rpcpass=kek
```

Before you can use `lnd` you'll need to wait for `btcd` to finish syncing
`testnet`. Depending on your connection and you computer this may take several hours. 


#### Installing lnd

With `btcd` installed and syncing, the next step is to repeat a similar process
to build and start `lnd`:

```
$ cd $GOPATH
$ git clone https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd
$ glide install
$ go install . ./cmd/...
```

Once the above commands are executed, you should have both `lnd` (the daemon)
and `lncli` (the command-line interface to the daemon) properly installed.

Finally, to start your `lnd` node, execute the following command (replacing
"kek" with your chosen `rpcuser` and `rpcpass` for `btcd` selected above)

```
lnd --testnet --rpcuser=kek --rpcpass=kek
```

### Docker Build

An alternative method of installing and running `lnd` is provided by [the `lnd` project's
`docker`
configuration](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/docker). The
`docker` setup provides automatic configuration for two distinct modes.

The first is a [local `lnd`
cluster](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/docker#create-lightning-network-cluster)
connected to `btcd` instance running in `simnet` mode. The `simnet` is similar
to Bitcoin Core's `regtest` mode in that is starts with a lower difficulty
allowing blocks to easily be generated by CPU's. This configuration allows
developers to spin up an arbitrary number of local `lnd` instances in order
to test new features or debug conditions seen in the wild. Think of this
configuration as a lighting-network-in-a-box.

The second supported configuration packages up a `btcd` node running on
`testnet` and also a single `lnd` node connected to the `btcd` node also
running on `testnet`. Assuming you have both `docker` and `docker-compose` set
up, launching this configuration can be done in just a few commands:

  * First we'll start up `btcd` running in `testnet` mode:

    ```
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/docker
    $ export BITCOIN_NETWORK="testnet"
    $ docker-compose up -d "btcd"
    ```

  * Next we'll start up our local `lnd` instance and connect it to `btcd`:

    ```
    $ docker-compose up -d "alice"
    ```

We can easily obtain a shell to execute `lncli` commands directly to our
running `lnd` node:

```
$ docker exec -i -t "alice" bash
$ lncli getinfo
```

Or access the running logs for either `btcd` or `lnd`: 

```
docker-compose logs alice
```

### Controlling `lnd` from The Command Line

Now that we have `lnd` up and running, we'll take a brief tour of the `lncli`
command, the command-line interface to controlling your `lnd` node. `lncli`
uses the `gRPC` interface to communicate directly with `lnd`. 

The first command we'll explore is `getinfo`. This command will display some
basic diagnostic information such as the latest block hash and our identity
public key:

```
▶ lncli getinfo
{
	"identity_pubkey": "0290bf454f4b95baf9227801301b331e35d477c6b6e7f36a599983ae58747b3828",
	"num_active_channels": 1,
	"num_peers": 1,
	"block_height": 1084917,
	"block_hash": "00000000000007d716eadfd64c238f41ccba93e9b2c3f92a28bb59c9880d1272",
	"synced_to_chain": true,
	"testnet": true
}%
```

The `identity_pubkey` field is the `secp256k1` public key for your node,
encoded in compressed-point format. Within the network, any channel
advertisements by your node will include a signature under your public key and
possibly signatures of other nodes in order to authenticate all information
advertised within the network.

In order to fund the wallet within your `lnd` node, so you can create channels,
you'll need to generate one of the two `segwit` enabled addresses that `lnd`
understands. 

If the source of your funds understands `lnd`'s native segwit addresses (for
example, `bcoin`) then you can generate a `p2wkh` (pay-to-witness-key-hash)
address to send to like so:

```
▶ lncli newaddress p2wkh
{
	"address": "QWzDax3tQJQdQpTK3G5329UmUmpDnTcj2inn"
}%
```

Otherwise, you'll need to use a nested p2sh address which are backwards
compatible to existing wallets:

```
▶ lncli newaddress np2wkh
{
	"address": "2Muf29PfJoFoRQQ9fpH86aYENboZQAZfezD"
}%
```

Once your funds have been sent, you can check your `lnd` wallet's available
balance (in `BTC`) using the `walletbalance` command:

```
▶ lncli walletbalance
{
	"balance": 4657.67016454
}%
```

The above command you shows the amount of funds you have available on-chain. In
order to query for your available off-chain balance (in `satoshis`), the
`channelbalance` command is provided:

```
▶ lncli channelbalance
{
	"balance": 99910000
}%
```

The logging provided by `lnd` is partitioned according to a particular
sub-system within the daemon. Within these sub-systems, 4 levels of logging are
exposed: `error`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`. The `trace` logging level is
the most verbose and will log each step taken by `lnd`, the `debug` mode is
less verbose but will still expose in detail the daemon's actions.

The `debuglevel` command is provided in order to allow users to dynamically
tune the logging verbosity of `lnd`. The command can either target a coarse
grained logging level: 

```
lncli debuglevel --level_spec=trace
```

Or target a particular sub-system with a fine grained target:

```
lncli debuglevel --level=UTXN=debug
```

At this point, you should have a fully synced `btcd` running in `testnet` mode
along with an active `lnd` node connected to it. Now it's time to experiment
with payment channels on the Lightning Network!

## The Testnet Lightning Faucet

In order to streamline the process of opening your first channel, we've created
the `Testnet Lightning Faucet`. 

The Testnet Lightning Faucet (TLF) is similar to other existing Bitcoin faucets.
However, rather than sending bitcoin directly on-chain to a user of the faucet,
the TLF will instead _open a payment channel_ with the target user. The user
can then either use their new link to the Lighting Network to facilitate
payments, or immediately close the channel (which immediately credits them
on-chain like regular faucets).

Currently, the TLF is only compatible with `lnd`, but in the near future as the
other Lightning implementations (eclair, c-lightning, lit, and more) become
available, our hope is that the faucet will also be usable with these active
implementations.

The faucet can be found at
[faucet.lightning.community](http://faucet.lightning.community).

### Faucet Constraints

Before we get started, it's worth pointing out that the TLF currently has a few
contraints:

  * The faucet will only create _one_ channel per user.
  * The maximum channel size the faucet will create is `4 million satoshis`
  * Finally, there's a minimum channel size of `10k satoshis`

### Claiming Your Channel

Once you visit
[faucet.lightning.community](http://faucet.lightning.community), you'll see
the following page:

![Faucet](/images/faucet-home.png)

In order to obtain your channel, you'll need to first connect out to the
faucet's `lnd` node:

```
lncli connect 036a0c5ea35df8a528b98edf6f290b28676d51d0fe202b073fe677612a39c0aa09@faucet.lightning.community:10011
```

The hex characters within that command are the faucet's public key. The public
key of a node is required to connect to a node due to the [Lightning Network's
peer-to-peer cryptographic messaging
scheme](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/08-transport.md).

Once you connect out to the faucet's node, it should show up under `lnd`'s list
of active peers:

```
▶ lncli listpeers
{
	"peers": [
		{
			"pub_key": "036a0c5ea35df8a528b98edf6f290b28676d51d0fe202b073fe677612a39c0aa09",
			"peer_id": 1,
			"address": "159.203.125.125:10011",
			"bytes_sent": 5012,
			"bytes_recv": 4646
		}
	]
}%
```

With your node connected, it's time to finally establish your channel! In order
to have the faucet create a channel with you, you'll need to fill out the three
fields in the Channel Creation form:

  1. Target Node
     * The public key of your node (obtained from the "identity_pubkey" field
       in the `getinfo` command)
  2. Channel Amount
     * The amount of satoshis the faucet should use to fund the channel.
  3. Initial Balance
     * The amount of satoshis to be pushed to your side as your "local balance"
       during channel creation. This allows you to start with some funds at the
       initial channel state. This value _must_ be less than the Channel Amount
       specified above.

Once the above fields are populated: 
![Faucet](/images/faucet-form.png)

Press the `SUBMIT` button in order to create your channel. If successful, you
should see a page like this:
![Faucet](/images/faucet-fin.png)

Exploring the link displayed on the page, you'll be able to see the funding
transaction which will ultimately open the channel [like this one
here](https://testnet.smartbit.com.au/tx/2e9fece24d4db39649edac3991d2e0913277a8ce5aec52e83fcd9c374aefb8d3).

Using the `pendingchannels` command, you'll be able to see the channel in the
making:

```
▶ lncli pendingchannels
{
	"pending_channels": [
		{
			"peer_id": 1,
			"identity_key": "036a0c5ea35df8a528b98edf6f290b28676d51d0fe202b073fe677612a39c0aa09",
			"channel_point": "2e9fece24d4db39649edac3991d2e0913277a8ce5aec52e83fcd9c374aefb8d3:0",
			"capacity": 2060000,
			"local_balance": 60000,
			"remote_balance": 2000000,
			"status": 1
		}
	]
}%
```

Note in the current release, you'll need to leave your computer active until
the next block arrives. Once the funding transaction confirms, you channel will
be open and you can monitor its state using the `listchannels` command:

```
▶ lncli listchannels
{
	"channels": [
		{
			"remote_pubkey": "036a0c5ea35df8a528b98edf6f290b28676d51d0fe202b073fe677612a39c0aa09",
			"channel_point": "2e9fece24d4db39649edac3991d2e0913277a8ce5aec52e83fcd9c374aefb8d3:0",
			"chan_id": 1192884354230517760,
			"capacity": 2005000,
			"local_balance": 60000,
			"remote_balance": 1940000
		}
	]
}%
```


### Sending a Multi-Hop Payment

Alright, so at this point you have a running `lnd` daemon connected to the
network on `testnet` and you have an active payment channel open with the
faucet. Now it's time to send some multi-hop payments!

A series of commands is bundled with `lncli` that allow you to explore the
channel graph from the PoV of your node: 

```
▶ lncli getnetworkinfo
{
	"avg_out_degree": 0.55,
	"max_out_degree": 5,
	"num_nodes": 20,
	"num_channels": 11,
	"total_network_capacity": 420010997,
	"avg_channel_size": 3.818281790909091e+07,
	"min_channel_size": 1000,
	"max_channel_size": 100000000
}%
```

As you can see from the above command at the time of writing, my local node
knew of 20 other `lnd` nodes connected by 11 channels within the network.
Amongst these channels, the total number of BTC contained within them tallies
up `4.2 BTC`.

The `describegraph` command will display your node's view of the active channel
graph (output is truncated):

```
▶ lncli describegraph
{
	"nodes": [
		<snip>
		{
			"last_update": 1484790531,
			"pub_key": "021b96642e723592ee0b095983fe3a26c8b40b8926968d8b7510e51c9429d4562c",
			"address": "[::]:10011",
			"alias": "021b96642e723592ee0b"
		},
		{
			"last_update": 1484470838,
			"pub_key": "03dd27dc7f994d932b74bebaf18bf801447a514eb4fb33b0f8000b33c036e51ed2",
			"address": "[::]:10011",
			"alias": "03dd27dc7f994d932b74"
		}
	],
	"edges": [
		<snip>
		{
			"channel_id": 1190433542811877376,
			"chan_point": "dc23b797a618ff0d56e43c164f3d52a109df7ff8a2ee81771f73da42430af273:0",
			"last_update": 1484423578,
			"node1_pub": "038988b891e37825182b3c65295c93b73a890e05d83a9db78e8e7ba8d736ec347b",
			"node2_pub": "03d09c932052547c16e83d676ed4014a09b5b2d9890b5ae35bf8d97459e9bb00ae",
			"capacity": 1000000,
			"node1_policy": {
				"time_lock_delta": 1
			},
			"node2_policy": {
				"time_lock_delta": 1
			}
		},
		{
			"channel_id": 1192884354230517760,
			"chan_point": "2e9fece24d4db39649edac3991d2e0913277a8ce5aec52e83fcd9c374aefb8d3:0",
			"last_update": 1484858485,
			"node1_pub": "0290bf454f4b95baf9227801301b331e35d477c6b6e7f36a599983ae58747b3828",
			"node2_pub": "036a0c5ea35df8a528b98edf6f290b28676d51d0fe202b073fe677612a39c0aa09",
			"capacity": 1999999,
			"node1_policy": {
				"time_lock_delta": 1
			},
			"node2_policy": {
				"time_lock_delta": 1
			}
		}
	]
}%
```

The `queryroute` command can be used to test the existence of a route between
your node and a target node:

```
▶ lncli queryroute --dest=03c3cbc887448ff950c32a3561441249f1983322519fcea18cbb7769cbd2f4b995 --amt=1000
{
	"total_time_lock": 3,
	"total_amt": 1000,
	"hops": [
		{
			"chan_id": 1192884354230517760,
			"chan_capacity": 1999999,
			"amt_to_forward": 1000
		},
		{
			"chan_id": 1190997592276926465,
			"chan_capacity": 100000000,
			"amt_to_forward": 1000
		},
		{
			"chan_id": 1192650158253473792,
			"chan_capacity": 100000000,
			"amt_to_forward": 1000
		}
	]
}
```

Here we see that from my node, I have a path that crosses 3 channels and 4
nodes to my target destination. We can see that the channel I created just now
(the `chan_id`'s match) with the faucet is the first-hop in my multi-hop route
to the destination.

If I'm not running with the `--debug-htlc` flag on, then once I obtain a
payment request from the payee, I'll be able to send the funds over Lightning:

```
▶ lncli sendpayment --pay_req=yxbhz1r8e1891wgdfe4snty1j8a3oc3nkgxh7ecczp5su16161h3kpu3a9a7pfs63aa14h9bsp17jppm53qquf1x8pzedobcsuouxqgpyyyyyyyyyyb6otom1t8o
{
	"payment_route": {
		"total_time_lock": 3,
		"total_amt": 1000,
		"hops": [
			{
				"chan_id": 1192884354230517760,
				"chan_capacity": 1999999,
				"amt_to_forward": 1000
			},
			{
				"chan_id": 1190997592276926465,
				"chan_capacity": 100000000,
				"amt_to_forward": 1000
			},
			{
				"chan_id": 1192650158253473792,
				"chan_capacity": 100000000,
				"amt_to_forward": 1000
			}
		]
	}
}%
```

The result of the `sendpayment` command shows the path that my payment traveled
along within the network to reach the final destination. If we check our
channel, we can see the latest state of the channel:

```
▶ lncli listchannels
{
	"channels": [
		{
			"remote_pubkey": "036a0c5ea35df8a528b98edf6f290b28676d51d0fe202b073fe677612a39c0aa09",
			"channel_point": "2e9fece24d4db39649edac3991d2e0913277a8ce5aec52e83fcd9c374aefb8d3:0",
			"chan_id": 1192884354230517760,
			"capacity": 2005000,
			"local_balance": 59000,
			"remote_balance": 1941000,
			"total_satoshis_sent": 1000,
			"num_updates": 2
		}
	]
}%
```

If we use the `decodepayreq` command, then we can see the payment conditions
encoded in the payment request:

```
▶ lncli decodepayreq --pay_req=yxbhz1r8e1891wgdfe4snty1j8a3oc3nkgxh7ecczp5su16161h3kpu3a9a7pfs63aa14h9bsp17jppm53qquf1x8pzedobcsuouxqgpyyyyyyyyyyb6otom1t8o
{
	"destination": "03c3cbc887448ff950c32a3561441249f1983322519fcea18cbb7769cbd2f4b995",
	"payment_hash": "3679c7f1d696dece312d73e1b365d4b5abde5ce9964f3b6e81c02cb4e137b8cd",
	"num_satoshis": 1000
}%
```

This concludes our walkthrough of `lnd`'s current capabilities, the Testnet
Lightning Faucet, and a multi-hop payment demonstration. Any questions or
issues can be directed at either the [`#lnd` channel on
freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lnd), or within the [Github
issues for `lnd`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues). 


## Testnet Lightning Faucet Source Code

The faucet demonstrated within this blog post is live on Testnet, is fully open
source and can be found
[here](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-faucet). The faucet is easy
to deploy as once it’s built, it generates a single statically linked binary
that only requires a local `lnd` in order to function. The source of the faucet
also includes automatic [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) registration
in order to obtain a _free_ TLS certificate for your personal channel faucet.

In the coming weeks, the TLF will expand into a full-blown channel explorer for
`lnd`'s sub-network on Bitcoin's Testnet. Once the channel explorer is
finished, a similar blog post will be uploaded explaining the features and
inner workings of the faucet.
